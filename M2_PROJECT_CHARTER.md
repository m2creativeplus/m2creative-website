## 🤖 COMPULSORY AI HANDOFF (READ THIS FIRST)
When an agent is spun up in this workspace, ALWAYS read this section before taking action.

- **Current State:** Active Next.js application. Deployed on Vercel. Integrates a modern, glassmorphic UI representing the M2 Sovereign aesthetic.
- **Next Immediate Action:** Maintain content alignment with the latest `M2_MARKETING_STRATEGY_2026.md` directives. Ensure contact forms or lead generation widgets are fully wired to backend databases (Convex).
- **Core Rules:**
  - DO NOT alter the core aesthetic: Must remain distinctively premium (Dark mode, explicit typography).
  - DO NOT change the canonical "Republic of Somaliland" references or symbols.
  - DO NOT create placeholder "under construction" pages. All routes must be functional.
